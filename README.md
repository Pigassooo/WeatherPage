# WeatherPage

HelloÔºÅ
I was inspired by the weather page on the Internet when I wasn't a coder.
This GitHub repository will progressively utilize an expanding array of technology stacks, culminating in the development of an increasingly sophisticated weather website.

## Weather Page Easy

This is a weather page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the page.
